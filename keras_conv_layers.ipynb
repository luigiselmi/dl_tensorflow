    "## 2D convolution \n",
    "The basic one is [Conv2D](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d/) that can be used to create a convolutional layer to extract the features from both the spatial dimensions (height and width) and the channel dimension in the same step. This layer is used in convolutional networks for image classification tasks. The main arguments of the layer are *filter* that is used to set the number of output feature maps, *kernel_size* that is used to set the size of kernel in the x and y directions, and *activation* that is used to select the activation function. The *dilation_rate* can be changed from the default value of (1,1) to (2,2) or other higher values to increase the field of view of the kernel. This configuration of the dilation rate is used in spatial pyramid pooling to collect features at different scale as object can appear at different scale/size in an image.  "

    "## Transposed convolution\n",
    "A transposed convolution, aka **atrous convolution** or **dilated convolution**, is used to increase the height and width of the input tensor, that is to upsample the input data, and decrease the number of feature maps. So, a transposed convolution represents the inverse of a convolution. The layer is used in the decoder part of an encoder-decoder network for semantic segmentation tasks. In order to increase the size of the input one common approach is to add rows and columns between the original pixel and to use algorithms such as [bilinear interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation) to compute the values of the added pixels from the values of the original ones. Keras provides the [UpSampling2D](https://keras.io/api/layers/reshaping_layers/up_sampling2d/) to do just that. This last approach does not perform well. Keras provides the [Conv2DTranspose](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d_transpose/) layer to perform the upsampling process."

    "## Depthwise convolution\n",
    "In several papers (e.g. [Xception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357)) it has been shown that performing the convolution operation on the spatial dimensions (height and width) separately from the channel dimensions increases the performance and reduces the number of parameters of the network. Keras provides the [DepthwiseConv2D](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/depthwise_convolution2d/) layer in which the convolution is computed separately for each channel"

    "Usually a depthwise convolution is followed by a 1x1 convolution, aka **pointwise convolution**, to reduce the number of feature maps. Keras provides the [SeparableConv2D](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/separable_convolution2d/) layer that implements a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution. This layer can be used in place of the Conv2D layer."
