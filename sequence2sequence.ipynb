    "# Deep Learning for text: sequence-to-sequence learning\n",
    "In this notebook we will implement a sequence-to-sequence model. This model takes an input sequence and returns another sequence. A sequence-to-sequence model is behind many machine learning tasks beyond classification such as: machine translation, text summarization, question answering, chatbots, and text generation. The sequence-to-sequence model has two components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder learns from the training set a representation that is useful for the task at hand. In machine translation the encoder maps equivalent terms found in a text in two vocabularies and the correct position in the target sequence. The decoder maps the representation into text in the target language."
